# Time Data Update

## Overview
This document describes the addition of time-of-day data to support Level 4 Time Choice analysis.

## What Was Added

### New Data Columns
Two time columns were added to `csv_data_optimized/Trips.csv`:
- `Trip_Departure_Time` - When the trip started (HH:MM:SS format)
- `Trip_Arrival_Time` - When the trip ended (HH:MM:SS format)

### New Analysis Features (Level 4: Time Choice)
1. **Overall Time-of-Day Profile** - Hourly distribution of all trips
2. **Time Profile by Activity** - Line charts showing when different activities occur
3. **Activity Time Heatmap** - Visual representation of activity timing patterns
4. **Peak Hours Analysis** - Peak travel times for each activity and time period breakdowns
5. **Time by Market Segment** - Compare travel timing across demographics
6. **Detailed Cross-Analysis** - Interactive analysis by activity and market segment

## How Time Data Was Added

The time columns were merged from the original full dataset:

```bash
# Run the merge script
python add_time_columns.py
```

The script:
1. Reads time columns from `../csv_data/Jaddah_Trips.csv` (original dataset)
2. Merges them into `csv_data_optimized/Trips.csv` by `Trip_id`
3. Maintains all existing data while adding time information

## Data Format

Time is stored in standard format:
- Format: `HH:MM:SS` (e.g., `10:00:00`, `14:30:00`)
- Range: 00:00:00 to 23:59:59
- Missing data: Represented as `00:00:00` or empty

## Usage in Analysis

The time analysis automatically:
- Extracts hour from time strings
- Groups trips by hour of day (0-23)
- Calculates percentages and distributions
- Identifies peak hours and time periods
- Segments analysis by activity purpose and demographics

## Time Period Classifications

Trips are classified into periods:
- **Early Morning**: 0-6 hours
- **Morning Peak**: 6-9 hours
- **Late Morning**: 9-12 hours
- **Midday**: 12-14 hours
- **Afternoon**: 14-17 hours
- **Evening Peak**: 17-20 hours
- **Night**: 20-24 hours

## Re-running the Update

If you need to re-merge time columns (e.g., after data updates):

```bash
cd /Volumes/MiniM4_ext/Projects/004-HHS-Analysis/deploy_v0.2
source venv/bin/activate
python add_time_columns.py
```

## Dependencies

The time analysis requires no additional packages beyond existing requirements:
- pandas (for data processing)
- plotly (for visualizations)
- streamlit (for dashboard)

All are already in `requirements.txt`.
